# Overview

Hi, My name is Jarvis Kwong.

I'm trying to create computer systems and applications to help the world to become a better place.

This is a budget summary that I made in C++ language.

I create this program to help popel to keep track on their budget.

The link below is a walkthrough of the code.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code and C++ to code.

# Useful Websites

- [C++ Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)

# Future Work

- Easier to input the data.
- Reduce the repetition when inputing data.
